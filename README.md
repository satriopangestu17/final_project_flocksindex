## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The purpose of this application is to give a prediction and an insight for traders or investors that use US Dollar for their investment in ASEAN capital market. <br>
The prediction in this apps is on daily basis. Thus, if you're a trader, you can make your techical prediction for the next day closing price of your US dollar to the currency of destination country and the country's capital market index based on the previous day closing price with ceteris paribus assumption.<br>
However, if you are an investor you can make your decision precisely with deliberations of risk, return, and the most appropriate thing, sharpe ratio.<br>
All those things you can get in here. Whether you are a trader, an investor, or both that use the uncle sam currency, surely you will get a lot of insight to your investment decision from this apps.<br>
